     <p>A pancake (or hot-cake, griddlecake, or flapjack) is a flat cake, often thin and<br> 
        round, prepared from a <strong> starch-based batter that may contain eggs, milk<br> 
        and butter</strong> and cooked on a hot surface such as a griddle or frying pan, often<br> 
        frying with oil or butter.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
     <ul>
       <li><strong>Flour:</strong> This homemade pancake recipe starts with all-purpose flour.</li>   
       <li><strong>Baking powder:</strong> Baking powder, a leavener, is the secret to fluffy<br> 
        pancakes.</li> 
       <li><strong>Sugar:</strong> Just a tablespoon of white sugar is all you'll need for subtly sweet<br> 
        pancakes.</li>
       <li><strong>Salt:</strong> A pinch of salt will enhance the overall flavor without making your<br> 
        pancakes taste salty.</li>
       <li><strong>Milk and butter:</strong> Milk and butter add moisture and richness to the<br> 
        pancakes.</li>
       <li><strong>Egg:</strong> A whole egg lends even more moisture. Plus, it helps bind the<br> 
        pancake batter together.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
     <ol>
        <li>Sift the dry ingredients together.</li>
        <li>Make a well, then add the wet ingredients. Stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Scoop the batter onto a hot griddle or pan.</li> 
        <li>Cook for two to three minutes, then flip.</li>
        <li>Continue cooking until brown on both sides.</li>
     </ol>
