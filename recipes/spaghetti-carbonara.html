  <p><strong>Carbonara</strong> is an Italian pasta dish from Rome made with <strong>eggs, hard cheese,<br>
    cured pork and black pepper.</strong> The dish arrived at its modern form, with its<br> 
    current name, in the middle of the 20th century.</p>
  
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
    <ul>
     <li>1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil or unsalted butter</li>
     <li>1/2 pound pancetta or thick cut bacon, diced</li>
     <li>1 to 2 garlic cloves, minced, about 1 teaspoon (optional)</li>
     <li>3 to 4 whole eggs</li>
     <li>1 cup grated Parmesan or pecorino cheese</li>
     <li>1 pound spaghetti (or bucatini or fettuccine)</li>
     <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
  
  <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
     <li>
        <strong><p>Heat the pasta water</p></strong> 
        <p>Put a large pot of salted water on to boil (1 tablespoon salt for every 2 <br>
          quarts of water.)</p>
     </li>
     <li>
        <strong>Sauté the pancetta or bacon and garlic</strong>
        <p>While the water is coming to a boil, heat the olive oil or butter in a large<br>
         sauté pan over medium heat. Add the bacon or pancetta and cook slowly<br> 
         until crispy.</p>
     </li>
     <li>
        <strong>Beat the eggs and half of the cheese</strong>
         <p>In a small bowl, beat the eggs
         and mix in about half of the cheese.</p>
     </li> 
     <li>
        <strong>Cook the pasta</strong>
        <p>Once the water has reached a rolling boil, add the dry pasta, and cook,<br>
         uncovered, at a rolling boil.</p>
     </li>
     <li>
        <strong>Toss the pasta with pancetta or bacon</strong>
        <p>When the pasta is al dente (still a little firm, not mushy), use tongs to<br> 
          move it to the bowl with the bacon and garlic. Let it be dripping wet. <br>
          Reserve some of the pasta water.</p>
        <p>Move the pasta from the pot to the bowl quickly, as you want the pasta<br> 
          to be hot. It's the heat of the pasta that will heat the eggs sufficiently to<br> 
          create a creamy sauce.</p>
        <p>Toss everything to combine, allowing the pasta to cool just enough so<br> 
          that it doesn't make the eggs curdle when you mix them in.<br> 
          (That's the tricky part.)</p>
     </li>
     <li>
        <strong>Add the beaten egg mixture</strong>
        <p>Add the beaten eggs with cheese and toss quickly to combine once more.<br> 
        Add salt to taste. Add some pasta water back to the pasta to keep it from<br> 
        drying out.</p>
     </li>
    </ol>
